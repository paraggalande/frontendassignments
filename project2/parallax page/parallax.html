    <h2>Switzerland</h2>
    <p>
        Practically the whole country is a single vacation spot. Switzerland has idyllic landscapes with a variety of snow-capped mountains and ice-cold mountain lakes, melting glaciers and mountain pastures well suited as downhill ski slopes in winter.
        The weather offers four seasons that effectively change the landscape.
